A Ruby parser for Caterwaul. This parser generates Caterwaul source trees so
that you can use Caterwaul macros against Ruby source, ultimately transforming
it into either more Ruby or into Javascript.

Note that Ruby source trees are no longer instances of caterwaul.syntax, since
they require different serialization logic.
