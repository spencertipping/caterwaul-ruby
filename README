A Ruby parser for Caterwaul. This parser generates Caterwaul source trees so
that you can use Caterwaul macros against Ruby source, ultimately transforming
it into either more Ruby or into Javascript. (I'm not necessarily committing to
a Javascript Ruby runtime in this project, but it wouldn't be too difficult to
implement given the AST.)
